# Deep-Learning-Specialization

This directory includes some of the projects I did for Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.

Face Recognition and Verification:
Used inception model to compute encoding of face images in a 128-dimensional vector which is used to calculate the
triple loss and recognize human faces in the database.

Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer:
Used VGG-19 for Transfer Learning and defining the style and content signature. Used Tensorflowâ€™s Adam
optimization on VGG-19 to minimize difference between generated image with style and content signature matrix.

Car Detection with YOLO Algorithm
Used YOLOv2 model. Implemented Score-thresholding and Non Max Suppression to filter out unnecessary output for
object detection.
